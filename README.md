# 30 Days of Dynamic Programming

Welcome to my **30 Days of Dynamic Programming Challenge**!  
I started this journey to strengthen my problem-solving skills, especially in DP which is a key area in coding interviews.

## 📅 Challenge Timeline
- **Start Date:** [May 5, 2025]

Each day, I'll solve one or more DP problems, write clean and well-commented code, and briefly explain the logic.  
The goal is to improve:
- Pattern recognition in DP
- Writing optimized, readable code
- Confidence for interviews
